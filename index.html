  <p> I love Harry Potter because it is interesting and I love books and movies that have magic and  unrealistic creatures. The characters are really good like Harry Potter, Ron and Ginny Weasley, Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom. The favourite fantasy creatures are Dragons, Pheonixes, Hippogriff and the Baslisk.</p><p> It is so wonderful to see the characters and the acters to grow up. There is also sad parts which are the parts when the characters pass away in the books. There is a reason for those       deaths. You can learn love and friendship from them. </p><p>In the wizarding world there is a sport called Quidditch. It is when you play on a broomstick. But I'm not telling any more, but if you would like to find out more. Read the books and watch the movies.</p>
